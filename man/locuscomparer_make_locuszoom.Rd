\title{Create a LocusZoom Plot for SNP Associations}
\usage{
locuscomparer_make_locuszoom(
  df,
  ylab = "-log10(p)",
  trait_title = "exposure",
  colour,
  shape,
  size
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{(data.frame) A data frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{pos} (numeric) - Position of the SNP on the chromosome.
\item \code{logp} (numeric) - -log10(p-value) for the SNP-trait association.
\item \code{rsid} (character) - SNP rsID.
\item \code{label} (character) - Optional label for SNPs, used for annotation. Only SNPs with non-empty labels will be annotated.
\item Additional columns for ggplot2::aesthetics, such as \code{colour}, \code{shape}, \code{size} that map to \code{rsid} values for visualization.
}
Example data frame:
\preformatted{
df <- data.frame(
  pos = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  logp = c(3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 1.5, 2.0),
  rsid = c("rs1", "rs2", "rs3", "rs4", "rs5"),
  label = c("", "", "Lead SNP", "", "Another SNP")
)
}}

\item{ylab}{(string) The label for the y-axis of the plot. This represents the measure of association, typically "-log10(p-value)". Default is \code{"-log10(p)"}.}

\item{trait_title}{(string) The title for the plot. This represents the name of the trait or association being visualized. Default is \code{"exposure"}.}

\item{colour}{(named vector) A vector specifying the colors for different SNPs. The names of the vector should correspond to \code{rsid} values.
Example: \code{c("rs1" = "#FF0000", "rs2" = "#0000FF", "rs3" = "#00FF00")}.}

\item{shape}{(named vector) A vector specifying the shapes for different SNPs. The names of the vector should correspond to \code{rsid} values.
Example: \code{c("rs1" = 21, "rs2" = 22, "rs3" = 23)}.}

\item{size}{(named vector) A vector specifying the sizes for different SNPs. The names of the vector should correspond to \code{rsid} values.
Example: \code{c("rs1" = 2, "rs2" = 3, "rs3" = 4)}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing the LocusZoom plot showing the SNP positions and their -log10(p-values) for the trait.
}
\description{
This function generates a LocusZoom-style plot, which visualizes the association between SNPs and a trait along a chromosome. The plot displays SNP positions and their significance (-log10(p-values)), with customizable ggplot2::aesthetics for different SNPs.
