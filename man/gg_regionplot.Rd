\usage{
gg_regionplot(
  df,
  rsid,
  chrom,
  pos,
  p_value,
  label = NULL,
  trait = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing genetic data. It must include the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{SNP}: SNP identifier (rsid).
\item \code{CHR}: Chromosome number.
\item \code{pos}: Position of the SNP (e.g., in base pairs).
\item \code{EA}: Effect allele (ref).
\item \code{OA}: Other allele (alt).
\item \code{phenotype}: The trait or phenotype associated with the SNP.
\item \code{p_value}: P-value for the association.
}}

\item{rsid}{A character vector of SNP identifiers to label on the plot.}

\item{chrom}{The chromosome number to be used for plotting.}

\item{pos}{The column name that contains the SNP positions.}

\item{p_value}{The column name containing the p-values for each SNP.}

\item{label}{A character vector of SNPs to label on the plot. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{trait}{The trait associated with the SNP. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{plot_pvalue_threshold}{The p-value threshold for plotting. SNPs with p-values greater than this threshold are excluded from the plot. Default is \code{0.1}.}

\item{genome_build}{The genome build used for the data (e.g., "GRCh38"). Default is \code{"GRCh38"}.}

\item{population}{The population for which the data was analyzed. Default is \code{"EUR"}.}

\item{plot_title}{The title of the plot. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{plot_subtitle}{The subtitle of the plot. Default is \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object containing the combined plot of region data with genetic variants, recombination rates, and gene annotations.
}
\description{
This function generates a region plot with genetic data for a given chromosome and
position range, and overlays it with recombination rates. Significant genetic
variants are highlighted with labels, and a gene plot is included below the main plot.
